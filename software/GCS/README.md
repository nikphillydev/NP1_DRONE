## NP1 Ground Control Station

The NP1 GCS software is a simple python application that reads from a USB serial port that NP1 FCC is sending data to. This data is formatted in such a way that the GCS software can parse and display the data into a GUI for visualization. The displayed information includes sensor data (IMU) and general logging information.
